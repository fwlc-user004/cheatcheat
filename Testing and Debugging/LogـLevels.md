# ðŸ“œ Log Levels Cheat Sheet

## ðŸ›  What are Log Levels?
Log levels define the **severity** and **importance** of log messages in an application. They help developers monitor, debug, and troubleshoot issues efficiently.

### ðŸŽ¯ Why Use Log Levels?
âœ… Helps in debugging and troubleshooting  
âœ… Improves system monitoring and performance analysis  
âœ… Prioritizes issues based on severity  
âœ… Reduces unnecessary logging overhead  
âœ… Enhances security by logging critical events

## ðŸš¦ Common Log Levels Explained

| Level       | Severity | Purpose | When to Use |
|------------|----------|---------|------------|
|ðŸŸ£**TRACE**| Lowest | Most detailed log level, logs every single step of execution | Debugging deeply nested logic, performance bottlenecks, and function calls |
|ðŸ”µ**DEBUG**| Low | Provides detailed diagnostic information useful for debugging | Understanding system behavior, diagnosing unexpected outputs |
|ðŸŸ¢**INFO**| Normal | Logs general operational events without problems | Application startup, shutdown, configuration changes, routine operations |
|ðŸŸ¡**WARN**| Medium | Highlights potential issues that might lead to errors | Deprecated API usage, performance warnings, unusual but non-fatal scenarios |
|ðŸ”´**ERROR**| High | Captures runtime issues that require immediate attention | API failures, exceptions, database connection issues, failed authentication |
|âš«**FATAL**| Critical | Logs system failures that cause application crashes | System crashes, data loss, unrecoverable errors |

## ðŸ”¥ Log Level Hierarchy (Least to Most Severe)

```
TRACE â†’ DEBUG â†’ INFO â†’ WARN â†’ ERROR â†’ FATAL
```

- **Lower Levels (TRACE, DEBUG, INFO)** â†’ Used during development for detailed insights.
- **Higher Levels (WARN, ERROR, FATAL)** â†’ Used in production to catch and report critical issues.

## ðŸ“Œ Example Logs for Each Level

```plaintext
[TRACE] Checking database connection step by step...
[DEBUG] User ID 1234 fetched from API.
[INFO] Application started successfully on port 8080.
[WARN] Deprecated method `oldFunction()` used, update recommended.
[ERROR] Payment gateway request failed. Response: 500 Internal Server Error.
[FATAL] Database connection lost! System shutting down.
```

## ðŸ”§ Best Practices for Logging

âœ… **Use appropriate log levels** â€“ Avoid logging everything at `ERROR` or `DEBUG`.  
âœ… **Avoid logging sensitive data** â€“ Never log passwords, API keys, or personal information.  
âœ… **Include context information** â€“ Add timestamps, request IDs, user details where needed.  
âœ… **Use structured logging** â€“ JSON format helps with parsing and searching logs.  
âœ… **Log exceptions properly** â€“ Capture stack traces to make debugging easier.  
âœ… **Rotate logs** â€“ Prevent excessive disk space usage with log rotation.  
âœ… **Monitor logs in production** â€“ Use tools like **ELK Stack, Splunk, Graylog, Loki, Prometheus**.

## âš¡ Structured Logging (JSON Format Example)
Instead of logging raw text, use structured logs:

```json
{
  "level": "error",
  "timestamp": "2025-02-22T12:34:56Z",
  "message": "Failed to process payment",
  "user_id": 12345,
  "order_id": "ORD56789",
  "error": "TimeoutException"
}
```

**Benefits of structured logging:**  
âœ” Easier to search and analyze logs  
âœ” Works well with log aggregation tools  
âœ” Better performance for large-scale systems

## ðŸš€ Logging Tools & Frameworks

| Language  | Popular Logging Frameworks |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Java**  | Log4j, SLF4J, Logback |
| **Python** | Logging Module, Loguru |
| **JavaScript (Node.js)** | Winston, Bunyan, Pino |
| **C#** | NLog, Serilog |
| **Go** | Logrus, Zap |
| **PHP** | Monolog |
| **Ruby** | Logger |
| **Shell (Linux)** | Syslog, journalctl |

## ðŸ”„ Setting Log Levels in Different Languages

### ðŸŸ¢ Java (Log4j)
```java
import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(MyClass.class);
logger.debug("This is a debug message");
logger.error("This is an error message");
```

### ðŸŸ¡ Python (Logging Module)
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logging.info("Application started")
logging.warning("This is a warning")
logging.error("This is an error")
```

### ðŸ”´ JavaScript (Winston)
```javascript
const winston = require('winston');
const logger = winston.createLogger({ level: 'info', transports: [new winston.transports.Console()] });
logger.info('App started successfully');
logger.error('Something went wrong');
```

### âš« C# (Serilog)
```csharp
using Serilog;
Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration().WriteTo.Console().CreateLogger();
Log.Information("App started successfully");
Log.Error("Critical failure detected!");
```

## ðŸš€ Final Thoughts

- **Log what matters** â€“ Avoid excessive or irrelevant logs.  
- **Use the right level** â€“ Keep debugging logs separate from production logs.  
- **Monitor & analyze logs** â€“ Logs are valuable for troubleshooting and security.
