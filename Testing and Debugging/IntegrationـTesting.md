# Integration Testing Cheat Sheet

## 🛠 What is Integration Testing?
Integration Testing is a level of software testing where individual units are combined and tested as a group to detect faults in their interactions.

## 🔍 Key Objectives
- Verify data flow between modules
- Ensure modules work together correctly
- Detect interface defects
- Identify integration issues early

## ⚡ Types of Integration Testing
1. **Big Bang Testing**  
   - All modules are integrated at once and tested together.  
   - 🔹 **Pros:** Simple, requires minimal planning.  
   - 🔹 **Cons:** Hard to debug, delayed defect detection.

2. **Incremental Testing**  
   - Modules are integrated and tested step-by-step.  
   - 🔹 **Types:**
     - **Top-Down:** Starts with high-level modules, stubs replace lower modules.  
     - **Bottom-Up:** Starts with lower-level modules, drivers replace higher modules.  
     - **Sandwich (Hybrid):** Mix of top-down and bottom-up approaches.

3. **Continuous Integration Testing**  
   - Automated integration testing in CI/CD pipelines.  
   - 🔹 **Tools:** Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Travis CI, CircleCI.

## 🏗 Approaches to Integration Testing
- **Black Box Testing** → Tests interfaces without internal knowledge.  
- **White Box Testing** → Tests internal structures and logic.  
- **Grey Box Testing** → Combination of both.

## 🔧 Tools for Integration Testing
| Tool            | Type               | Features |
|----------------|------------------|-----------|
| Selenium       | UI Testing        | Automates browser testing |
| JUnit / TestNG | Unit + Integration | Java-based frameworks |
| Postman       | API Testing       | Tests RESTful services |
| SoapUI        | API Testing       | SOAP and REST testing |
| Cucumber      | BDD Testing       | Behavior-driven development |

## 🏆 Best Practices
✅ Define clear test scenarios  
✅ Automate where possible  
✅ Use mocks/stubs for dependencies  
✅ Test positive & negative cases  
✅ Log and document defects  
✅ Integrate tests into CI/CD pipelines  

## 📌 Example Integration Test Case
**Test Case:** Verify Login API works correctly with the Database.  
**Steps:**
1. Send a POST request to `/login` with valid credentials.
2. Validate response status `200 OK`.
3. Check if a valid session token is generated.
4. Verify if the database updates the login timestamp.

## 🔥 Common Challenges
❌ Data inconsistency issues  
❌ External dependency failures  
❌ Environment configuration mismatches  
❌ API contract mismatches  

## 🚀 CI/CD Integration Strategy
1. Run unit tests first.
2. Deploy components to a staging environment.
3. Execute integration tests.
4. Run regression tests before production deployment.

## 🎯 Final Thoughts
- Integration Testing ensures system components work seamlessly.
- Early detection of integration issues saves time & effort.
- Combining automation with CI/CD enhances efficiency.
